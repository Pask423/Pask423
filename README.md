# Hi, I'm Bartek! 👋

Senior Software Engineer focused on robust, scalable systems. I work mostly in **Java/JVM** (and **Python**), designing and operating **distributed systems** and the trade-offs that make them run at scale.

I also write **[Limitless System Design](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/limitless-system-design-7335259589879197700/)** — a LinkedIn newsletter exploring practical architecture patterns.
